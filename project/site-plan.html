        <h1>Project Site Plan : Ballistics Calculator</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p><strong>BallisticsPro</strong></p>
        <p>This name reflects the professional and technical nature of the website, which is a ballistics calculator
            designed for shooters. It emphasizes accuracy and expertise ("Pro"), appealing to hunters, competitive
            shooters, and firearms enthusiasts who need precise trajectory predictions. While domain availability isn't
            required for this class, a potential domain like ballisticspro.com would align with the branding.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The BallisticsPro website serves as a tool for shooters to calculate bullet trajectories, drop, velocity,
            energy, and wind drift. It provides an intuitive interface to input firearm, ammunition, and environmental
            data, offering detailed results in a table and visual chart. Additional features include saving and
            comparing load profiles, exporting range cards, and real-time adjustments for environmental factors, making
            it a practical resource for long-range shooting.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the bullet drop and wind drift for my .308 Winchester at 500 yards with a 10 mph crosswind?</li>
            <li>How can I compare the trajectories of my two favorite rifle loads to choose the best one for a hunting
                trip?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These questions reflect the needs of the target audience—hunters and competitive shooters—who want to
            optimize their shooting accuracy and make informed decisions about their equipment.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <p>The color schema uses two primary colors inspired by the Ohio State University palette to create a bold and
            professional design:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>#BB0000 (OSU Scarlet)</strong>: Used for headers, buttons, and borders to convey energy and draw
                attention, aligning with the technical focus of the ballistics calculator.</li>
            <li><strong>#FFFFFF (OSU White)</strong>: Used for the background to ensure readability and provide strong
                contrast with the scarlet elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional colors like OSU Black (#000000), OSU Gray (#666666), OSU Light Gray (#B0B0B0), and OSU Dark Gray
            (#333333) may be used for accents, text, or dark mode in the final site. A shadow color (rgba(0, 0, 0,
            0.65)) may be used for depth effects. These colors are applied to this planning document to demonstrate
            their usage.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>The typography includes two fonts to create a rugged, technical aesthetic while ensuring readability:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stardos Stencil (Sans-Serif)</strong>: Used for headings (h1, h2, h3) to provide a bold,
                stencil-style look that reflects the precision and utility of a ballistics calculator.</li>
            <li><strong>Allerta Stencil (Sans-Serif)</strong>: Used for body text, including paragraphs and lists, to
                maintain a consistent stencil theme while ensuring clarity across devices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both fonts fall back to Arial and serif if unavailable. These fonts are applied to this planning document to
            reflect their intended usage.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <h3>Mobile View (Home Page)</h3>
        <p>The mobile view uses a single-column layout for simplicity, ensuring usability on smaller screens:</p>
        <img src="images/mobile-wireframe.png" alt="Mobile Wireframe for BallisticsPro Home Page">
        <p><strong>Description</strong>: The header includes the logo and a hamburger menu icon for navigation. The main
            section has a prominent "Calculate Now" button (in OSU Scarlet, #BB0000) that opens a modal form for inputs.
            Below, the results table and trajectory chart are stacked vertically to fit the narrow screen. The footer
            contains copyright information.</p>

        <h3>Desktop View (Home Page)</h3>
        <p>The desktop view uses a two-column layout to optimize space and usability on larger screens:</p>
        <img src="images/desktop-wireframe.png" alt="Desktop Wireframe for BallisticsPro Home Page">
        <p><strong>Description</strong>: The header includes the logo on the left and navigation links on the right. The
            main section is split into two columns: the left column (40% width) contains the "Calculate Now" button (in
            OSU Scarlet, #BB0000) to trigger the input modal; the right column (60% width) displays the results table
            and trajectory chart side by side. The footer spans the bottom with copyright information.</p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: The images above are placeholders to be replaced with actual wireframe sketches
            created in a tool like Figma or on paper (scanned/photographed).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>I will self-check and evaluate this site plan and the final website using common tools from the class,
            including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML/CSS Validation</strong>: Use the W3C Markup Validation Service and CSS Validation Service
                to ensure code compliance.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Test with WAVE or axe DevTools to ensure proper ARIA labels and keyboard
                navigation (e.g., for the modal).</li>
            <li><strong>Best Practices</strong>: Follow semantic HTML and CSS best practices (e.g., using &lt;dialog&gt for
                    modals, avoiding inline styles).</li>
            <li><strong>Color Contrast</strong>: Use WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify that #BB0000 text on #FFFFFF
                background meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards (contrast ratio is 9.5:1, which passes).</li>
            <li><strong>SEO</strong>: Ensure meta tags (title, description) are included and use semantic HTML for
                better search engine indexing.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance</strong>: Test with Lighthouse to optimize load times (e.g., minify CSS, use
                efficient Chart.js for charts).</li>
        </ul>
